This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: using an uninitialized variable after exiting a loop prematurely.  The variable 'I' in the provided code is only assigned a value within the loop. If the loop exits early (before the array element 5 is encountered), 'I' remains uninitialized, leading to unpredictable results when used after the loop.  The solution involves initializing I to a default value or checking for loop termination conditions.
